## Overview

This repository contains three distinct Python web applications, each serving a unique purpose:

1. **Insurance Predictor**: Predicts health insurance premiums based on user inputs.
2. **Calories Burner Tracking App**: Estimates calories burned during a workout session based on various input parameters.
3. **STEAMLAB BASICS**: Demonstrates basic and advanced concepts in Python and data science.

## Projects

### 1. Insurance Predictor

The Insurance Predictor app is designed to predict health insurance premiums. It uses a machine learning model to provide accurate predictions based on user inputs such as age, gender, BMI, and smoking status.

#### Features
- 🖥️ User-friendly interface for inputting personal information.
- 📊 Real-time premium prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- 📉 Provides insights into factors affecting insurance premiums.

#### Demo

### 2. Calories Burner Tracking App

The Calories Burner Tracking App estimates the number of calories burned during a workout session. It takes various input parameters such as gender, age, height, weight, workout duration, heart rate, and body temperature to provide accurate predictions.

#### Features
- 🏋️ Interactive interface for inputting workout details.
- 🔥 Real-time calorie burn prediction using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- 📊 Insights into how different factors affect calorie burn.

     ```
   - For Calories Burner Tracking App:
     ```bash
     streamlit run calories_app.py
     ```

## Usage

1. Open the respective application in your web browser.
2. Fill in the required input fields.
3. Click on the "Predict" button to get the results.

## Dependencies

- `streamlit`
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`

These dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file and can be installed using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command.

## Learnings

Through these projects, I gained extensive experience with:

- **Streamlit**: Creating interactive web applications, handling user inputs, and displaying predictions.
- **Machine Learning**: Training and using machine learning models for prediction tasks.
- **Python**: Utilizing Python libraries such as pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Web App Development**: Building and deploying complete web applications.

## Deployment

The apps can be deployed to various platforms, such as Heroku or Streamlit Sharing. Below is a brief overview of deploying an app to Streamlit Sharing:

1. **Prepare the repository:**
   Ensure your repository contains all necessary files, including the app scripts (`insurance_app.py`, `steamlab_basics_app.py`, `calories_app.py`), `requirements.txt`, and the pre-trained models.

2. **Deploy to Streamlit Sharing:**
   - Log in to Streamlit Sharing.
   - Click "New App" and connect your GitHub repository.
   - Select the branch and file (e.g., `insurance_app.py`) to deploy.
   - Click "Deploy" and wait for the app to be live.
